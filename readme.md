# 21Sim
A Simplified BlackJack(21) Simulator

## Overview
I am going to be creating a simplified Blackjack simulator. The project will allow a user to play blackjack solo, watch a computer play, or play simultaneously with a computer. The player will start with a set amount of money and be able to occupy as many seats as they so desire. There will be a variety (at least one) of computer players that follow different pre-determined sets of logic such as optimal play, random selection, and so on. 

Additional information will be tracked and displayed to the player such as the current count (card counting) and the number of cards left in the shoe. If time permits, I would like to implement an assist system, where the player is notified if they are making a move that does not follow basic strategy and reduces their chances of winning.

## How to Run

The simulator is initiated by running the main.java file located at `src/FXRunner/Main.java`. Running this prompt the user (in a popup) to enter their name. This will close once submitted and the rest of the game will be in the terminal.

***The game itself is not yet implemented at this point, simply the table setup.***
